ask: Build a Contact Form using HTML, CSS & JavaScript 📝

I created a contact form that:

- Validates your input to ensure it's accurate ✅, so you can be confident that your message will be delivered correctly.
- Works great on all devices, big or small 📱, making it easy for users to get in touch with us from anywhere.
- Has a clean and user-friendly design 🎨, providing a seamless experience for users.
- Shows a confirmation message when you click Submit, letting you know your message has been sent successfully 📝, giving you peace of mind that your message has been received.

I'm proud of what I've accomplished and look forward to learning more! 🚀 I'm excited to continue growing my skills and taking on new challenges in the world of web development.
